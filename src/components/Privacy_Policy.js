        By using our website and placing an order, you agree to our terms and
        conditions. All products listed are subject to availability and may be
        withdrawn or modified at any time without prior notice. We make every
        effort to ensure the accuracy of product descriptions, images, and
        pricing, but errors may occur. If we discover an error in the price or
        availability of any product you have ordered, we will inform you as soon
        as possible and give you the option of reconfirming your order or
        cancelling it. All prices are listed in \[Currency] and include
        applicable taxes unless stated otherwise. We reserve the right to change
        prices at any time. Payment must be made in full before your order is
        processed and dispatched. We use secure third-party payment gateways to
        process your transactions, and we do not store your payment details.
        Shipping and delivery timelines provided on the website are estimates
        and not guarantees. We are not responsible for any delays caused by
        logistics partners or unforeseen circumstances. Once your order is
        shipped, you will receive tracking information to monitor the delivery
        status. It is the responsibility of the customer to provide accurate and
        complete information at the time of checkout. Any errors in shipping
        details may result in delayed or failed delivery, and additional charges
        may apply for re-shipment. Returns and refunds are accepted as per our
        return policy, which is available on the website. Products must be
        returned in their original condition and packaging. Refunds will be
        processed to the original payment method within a reasonable timeframe
        after we receive and inspect the returned item. By continuing to use our
        website, you agree to these terms and acknowledge that they may be
        updated periodically. We recommend reviewing this section regularly to
